# CMOS SPICE Simulations

This repository contains **SPICE simulations of NMOS, PMOS, and CMOS inverters** using various device models.  
It is designed to help students, researchers, and enthusiasts understand **MOSFET device behavior, CMOS inverter characteristics, and circuit robustness** under different operating conditions.

The simulations explore both **DC and transient behaviors**, considering **parameter variations, device sizing, and supply voltage effects**.
